# Offenseval and semantic change

Repository for research project on measuring the effect of semantic change detection systems on the detection of offensive language.
We rely on two tasks from SemEval 2020:
1) Offenseval (task 12) https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.07235.pdf
2) Unsupervised lexical semantic change detection (task 1) https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.11464.pdf

Team: Jonathan Cook (implementation of experiments and code documentation), Barbara McGillivray (experimental design, supervision).

For 1 we chose the best-performing system.
For 2 we chose the best-performing system, SIMPAC (Ondrej et. al). See directory.
